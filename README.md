# EEE192 Capstone

*Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of interconnected objects through sensors and the internet, enabling them to communicate. In this project, an IoT-based indoor plant monitoring system with virtual actuators was developed to monitor environmental parameters related to Golden Pothos health as well as indoor climate quality, via the STM32F411RE development board. The sensor readings were collected to the Thingspeak database and displayed to a web interface that shows reading implications, actuator states, and room environment quality, with and without the Golden Pothos. Results show that the plants reduced the room temperature but had no effects to other factors. But this project has limited resources thus limited generalizability.
